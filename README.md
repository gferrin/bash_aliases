# bash_aliases

My custom bash commands

### To Use

Copy the main `.bash_aliases` file to your root directory 

```bash
cp ~/projects/bash_aliases/.bash_aliases ~/.bash_aliases
```

and then in either your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file (which should also be in your `~` root) add the line 

```bash 
source ~/.bash_aliases
```

You'll now be able to use all of my custom bash commands.
